This repository is roughly divided into two sections: Docker-based system to keep track of archival files ([`tiramisu`](tiramisu/README.md)), training and inference scripts for handwriting extraction & entity recognition ([`handwriting_extraction`](handwriting_extraction/README.md) and [`entity_recognition`](entity_recognition/README.md)).
